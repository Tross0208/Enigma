## Self evaluation
  - Functionality: 3 - Enigma encrypts and decrypts messages utilizing the command prompt. Cracking method was not implemented.
  
  - OOP: 3.5 - Modules were utilized logically, but flow and organization leaves room for improvement.

  - Ruby conventions and mechanics: 2.5 - Naming follows proper structure and purposes are made clear. Most enumerables are efficient. Some methods are a bit longer than neccessary and could be refactored. Hash could have been implemented better/more extensively throughout.

  - TDD: 3.5 - Rspec shows 100% coverage in testing, but some edge cases may have been neglected.
